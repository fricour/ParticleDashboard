# Biogeochemical-Argo Floats Particle Dashboard

## Overview
This dashboard visualizes particle data collected from drifting Biogeochemical-Argo (BGC) floats (i.e. when those floats are parked at a given depth: 200 m, 500 m or 1000 m). 
It provides an interactive interface to explore float trajectories, particle concentrations, size spectra, and carbon flux data.

## Data Source
These data were collected and made freely available by the International Argo Program and the national programs that contribute to it. The Argo Program is part of the Global Ocean Observing System.

## Data Selection

- Size class (Î¼m): Select the particle size class to display in the particle concentration plot.
- Parking depth (m): Choose from 200 m, 500 m, or 1000 m depths.
- Float WMO: Pick specific floats by their WMO (World Meteorological Organization) numbers.
- Color by region toggle: Option to color-code data by geographical regions.
